                    The future of technology in education is helping teachers to expand beyond linear, text-based
                    learning and to engage students who learn best in other ways. ... Also, students that feel like
                    studying from home can now do it. Advancement of information technology in education has improved
                    research.</p>

                Sheridan's Technology Fundamentals program is ideal if you're interested in a technology career, but
                aren't sure which specific area of study is the best fit for you. In this program, you'll experiment
                with five subject areas — chemistry, engineering, architecture, information technology and trades —
                helping you decide what you want to focus on in your career.
                Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) is important for many reasons. It is not only important because it is
                the standard of education that is expected today, but it can also improve education. This section
                explores TEL’s importance in more detail.
                We know that kids learn at their own pace, and sometimes the traditional classroom makes it difficult to
                do so. Technology in education enables children to adjust to their own pace of learning. Students who
                need extra time can spend more time going over exercises until they understand, whilst students who need
                less support can continue ahead. It also frees up the teacher to help kids who need more support on an
                individual level.

                The term Technology-enhanced learning (TEL) is used to describe the application of technology to
                teaching and learning. It is a broad category that isn’t particularly defined, but, in short, TEL is any
                technology that enhances the learning experience. The term can be used to describe both analogue and
                digital technologies, but more recently, we see that digital TEL is taking over education in the form of
                different types of educational software. TEL is transforming and enhancing education and educational
                institutions beyond recognition. Therefore, it is impossible to be ignored! Let’s explore why TEL is
                important for educators.
                There we introduced our new service: “Apiumhub University ” and explained why we decided to launch it.
                Basically, as there is currently a problem of finding a high qualified developer for a reasonable price,
                a lot of startups and big enterprises were asking Apiumhub for a training opportunity. And with the
                objective of not just getting the talent, but growing it and scale it, we launched our own “University”.
                With the help of our renowned software architect Christian Ciceri and other high qualified experts from
                our team, Apiumhub gives personalized training, theoretical and practical tasks based on real projects,
                ensuring their clients have talents that they need.

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">
                Helen Brand, chief executive of ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants), says,
                “Understandably, digital skills are now essential and will only grow in importance in the coming decade.
                As new and upcoming technologies arrive thick and fast, a digital focus is no longer a luxury—it’s a
                necessity.” This isn’t new advice for management accountants, as we watch organizations increasingly
                rely on technology to facilitate accounting and business functions. But it’s frustrating to be reminded
                about the importance of developing technology skills without a clear picture about the skills we need to
                learn, let alone how to learn them. The right technology-learning strategies for management accountants
                help prepare us for the rise of the digital focus on information processing.
                Technology tools that are implemented without an understanding of an organization’s management
                accounting and business processes probably aren’t sustainable. Management accountants should be part of
                the team that identifies,
